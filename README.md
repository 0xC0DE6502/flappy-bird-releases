## Aim of the game

Fly as long as you can.

## How to play

There are 2 main ways to play the game:
1. Use the [tape image](https://github.com/0xC0DE6502/flappy-bird-releases/raw/main/flappy-bird.uef) on real hardware or an emulator
2. Use the [disk image](https://github.com/0xC0DE6502/flappy-bird-releases/raw/main/flappy-bird.ssd) on real hardware or an emulator

## Controls

```
Any key - Start game / Fly
Q       - Start a Quiet game
```

## I keep dying quickly, what gives?

Git gud. Or try Easy mode :wink:

### Easy mode

Hold `SHIFT` when the game finishes loading to enter Easy mode. You will notice the score is drawn in black instead of the usual yellow colour. In Easy mode, the gap between the top and bottom pipes is much larger, thus making the game easier.
